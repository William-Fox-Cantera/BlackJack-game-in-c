# BlackJack-game-in-c
This is a fun little blackjack game I made from scratch in c. You start the game and choose to either hit or stand being careful not to go over 21 while still beating the dealer.

Uses gcc compiler, and utilizes a Makefile to make things more organized. If you plan on running this on the command line, use        make->./game to run run the game. Have fun!
